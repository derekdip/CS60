Determination
    value of one attribute can detemine the value of another

Dependencies
    Functional dependence
        1:1 or 1:m or m:m attributes determine other attributes

        -Determinant
        -Dependent
    Full functional dependence
        all determinants are needed to populate the dependant

Keys
    Used to point at a specific row of a table
    
    Primary Key
        point to a row of a table
    Key Types
        Composite Key
            points to one or more attributes
        Key attribute
            attribute that needs to be defined for the row
        Entity integrity
            condition  that each row of a table is unique  
                no two keys are the same 
                key attributes are defined
        Null
            absence of data
        Referential integrity
            Every reference to an entity instance by another entity instance is valid
        Secondary key
            used strictly for data retrieval purposes

Null Handling
    Flags
        Special codes used to indicate the absence of some value
    NOT NULL constraint
        values in the column must be defined
    UNIQUE constraint
        no two values in a column have the same value

    way of manipulating table contents with relational operators
