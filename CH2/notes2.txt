Objectives:
    About data modeling and why data models are important
    About the basic data-modeling building blocks
    What business rules are and how they influence database design
    How the major data models evolved
    About emerging alternative data models and the need they fulfill
    How data models can be classified by their level of abstraction


Data modeling:

Data models:
    Simple representations of complex realworld data structures
    Entity:
        Unique and distinct object used to collect and store data
        Attribute:
            characteristic
    Relationship:
        Describes an association among entities
    Constraint: 
        Set of rules to ensure data integrity
Model: 
    Abstraction of a real-world object or event

Buisness Rules:
    allow designers to define parameters in data and how it may be used

    nouns->entities
    verbs->relationship between entities
    relationships <-> work both ways

Naming Conventions:
    Entity:
        descriptive
        familiar to others
    Attribute:
        descriptive of data represented
    Proper:
        com between parties
        self-document
    
Models:
    **Hierarchical:
        manage large data for complex projects
        upsidedown tree (file system's record type)
        one-to-many
    **Network:
        describes complex data relationships
        improves db performance and standart
        allows more parents
        1:M or M:M

Schema:?
    conceptual blueprint of whole db
Subschema: ???
    blueprint generated by programs(hasura and its user interface)

Data manipulation language (DML):
    Environment where data can be manged
Schema data definition language (DDL):
    used by db administrator to define schema components

**Relational Model:
    Relation/Table:
        Matrix composed of intersecting tuple and attribute
        Tuple->Rows
        Attribute->Columns

Relational DB Management System (RDBMS):
    Makes the RDM modal easier to understand and hides complexities from user

SQL-Based Relational DB Application:
    End-user Interface (a user that uses the app):
        Allowed to interact with data (instagram users can upload, edit, delete from db)
    Collection of tables:
        tables are independent
        rows in different tables are related based on common values in common attributes
    SQL engine:
        exexutes queries

**Entity Relationship Model:
    graphical representation of entities and relationships in a db structure
    Entity relationship diagram (ERD):
        graphical representation to model db components
    Entity instance or entity occurrence:
        rows in relational tables
    Connectivity:
        term to lable relationship types

**The Object-Oriented Data Model (OODM) or Semantic Data Model:
    OODMS
    Object:
        data
        relationships with operations that are performed on it (isEquals, isNull?, isNumeric)
    attributes:
        properties of obj
    Class:
        Collection of similar objects with shared structure
        Class hierarchy:
            inseption of classes
        inheritence:
            object inherits methods and attributes passed down from parent classes
        Unified Modeling Language (UML):
            describes diagrams and symbols to graphicaly rep a system

Extended relational data model (ERDM):
    modeling methods that help build out a system
    supports object oriented features and complex data
    Extensible Markup Language (XML):
        manages unstructured data

Big Data:
    aims to manage large amounts of web and sensor generated data
    aims to provide high performance and scalablity for low cost
    characteristics:
        volume
        velocity
        variety
    chalenges:
        expensive
        dealing with unstructured data
    Technologies:
        Hadoop
        NoSQL
        MapReduce
        Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)

**NoSQL DB
    not based on the relational model
    high scalablity, availability and fault tolerance
    supports large amounts of data
    tuned for performance not accuracy
